# Snake-game ✨
(⌐■_■)
### Introduction
Feeling nostalgic? This is the replica of the old mobile game where there is a snake, and its size increases as it eats more food. But the catch is it should not collide with the boundaries or itself for being alive.<br>
The score is the length of the snake. And more the length, the more the chances of winning the game.
### Description
It is C++ based on desktop app that runs in the terminal.


### To run:
- Just paste code in any c++ compiler and run the code and enjoy the awesome game...
